# Simple Javascript Projects

This repository contains a list of simple projects I'm working on, while improving my knowledge of *JavaScript*, *HTML*, and *CSS*.

Most (if not all) of the projects are based on the Udemy course [JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/). 

To check each project it is only necessary to open the index.html file in a browser of one's choice.
